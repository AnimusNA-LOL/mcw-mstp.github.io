# Welcome to MSTP Codes :wave:

This is a website to share information and resources about mcw mstp. We are
currently taking suggestions for pages and information that you would like
be made available.

!!! warning
    This site is currently under construction and is just for demo
    purposes

This site was built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and uses the [material]() theme.

## Layout

I was thinking that the primary pages could run accross the header. 

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
