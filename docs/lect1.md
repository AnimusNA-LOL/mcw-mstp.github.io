# Lecture 1

These slides are part of a workshop by the Cui Lab on 6/21/21 about how to use R to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data. It starts by going over the basics of scRNA-seq and how it differs from bulk RNA-seq. We'll then download a publicly available dataset and analyze it together using the attached script.
